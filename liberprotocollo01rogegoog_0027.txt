But sharing in the exaggerations which have so dis-
figured the early history of the city, it has been the
fashion for the successiva historiens of Glasgow to
assert that, “besides eigilem baronries of land
which belonged to them’' [the bishops] “within the
Sheriffdoms of PeebleS, Selkirk, Roxburgh, DumfrieS,
and Stuartry of Annandale, they had likewise a great
estate in the province of Cumberland, in England,
within their jurisdiction, being named of old the
spiritual Dukedom,” otc*

How the gross money rental of ο8987, 8's. rd. was
apportioned among these seven baronies does not
exactly appear. The rental of Stobo at the General
Assumption was stated at 2107 in money, and that
of Eddilstoun, so far as tho Archbishop possessed it
in property, at the same period, was 223, 18s. 4d. It
is not likely, at that unsettlod time, that Border
baronias, such as Alacrwm, Asiati-l, or Lilliesleas,
which were the first to suffer from an English inva-
sion and the constant depredatione of the marchmen,
would yield a large money rental; while Ceremirs,
though situated in the quieter district of Lanarkshire,

ol Glnsgow, Curstairs, Ancnrm, Lilliesleal, uskirk, Stobo,and Ediston, with
ye Bishop's Forest, and other little things in Curriclr, Lothisn, and else·
where” (Boolm oi Assumption).

Thus, even allowing lor the differenee in the velue oi money three hun-
dred years ago, and putting a price on the large quantity oi grain in which
the prelste’s rents were pnid (not lorgctting the ionrteen dozcn ol salmonae
appropriatos pryment to the successor oi St Kentigem), the Glssgow
rental fell iar short ol' the rerenues ol the great English sees.
